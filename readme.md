# Artiphon Gadget

Some gadgets I build for my Artiphone Instrument1.

## Guitar key remap

Remap guitar notes into chords or samples.

* e string -> major CDEFGAB
* B string -> minor CDEFGAB
* other -> some loop or sampls.

To run: 

* set guitar "Capo Step Size"=12 in Artiphon setup app.
* load `guitar_key_remap.rb` in 
[Sonic-pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
* Run sonic-pi.
* Press "Capo Step" down 3 times to call remapping. Remapping can be disabled by resetting Capo Step to normal.
